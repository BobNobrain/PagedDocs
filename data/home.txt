`[Quick user guide]
The web page you're looking at right now is an interface of navigation and
wiki-browsing system. It contains 3 parts: a `/toolbar` with some useful functions
at the top of the page, a `/navigation tree` at the left side and the `/pages viewer`
containing this text.


Toolbar contains two tabs: `/navigation tab` and `/view tab`. In the former, all the
functions you can use to navigate across pages are placed:
`{*
	`+ `/Scroll-to-top button` (evident);
	`+ `/Journal section` allows you to manage and navigate across your browsing history;
	`+ `/Search section` provides you with search tools.
`}
The latter contains visual settings of the page, such as:
`{*
	`+ `/Color theme section` allows you to find the most comfortable look of the page;
	`+ `/Syntax hilighting section` can be used to ajust default appearance settings of code blocks at the page.
`}


The tree can be used for navigating directly to the page, built into the whole
documentation ierarchy.

And the viewer allows you to see a rendered wiki-page, containing differently
formatted text blocks, tables and images.
